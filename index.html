                            I'm Caleb Chan and am currently pursing a degree in computer science.
                            As such, I every now and then I will design a project, write documentation
                            on how my programs work, or possibly analyze how other programs work.
                            <br><br>
                            My primary interests are concerned around developing software and network
                            security. Besides the usual grind, there are also plenty of other fun stuff that
                            I would love to join in on, such as pizza chugging, capture the flag (security game),
                            and more!

                <p>My general programming include: Python, Flask, C++, x86 Assembly Language, HTML, and CSS.
                    Some other skills that may be of interest includes Forensics.
                    You can be assured that my code is of the quality and is well-documented
                    and organized.
